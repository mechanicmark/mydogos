      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>The Cavoodle, also known as the Cavapoo, is a charming cross between a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and a Poodle. 
        Loved for their gentle nature, intelligence, and low-shedding coats, Cavoodles make wonderful family companions.
      </p>

      <p>They’re known for being affectionate, social, and great with children — always eager to please and quick to learn. 
        Thanks to their Poodle heritage, Cavoodles come in various coat types and colors, often with soft, curly or wavy fur that’s easy to maintain with regular grooming.
      </p>

      <p>Whether living in a small apartment or a spacious home, Cavoodles adapt easily to their surroundings. 
        Their friendly personalities and loving temperament make them one of Australia’s most popular designer dog breeds.
